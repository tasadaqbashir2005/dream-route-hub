      <p>Planning your <strong>Umrah journey from Pakistan in 2026</strong> is easier than ever thanks to Saudi Arabia's digital Nusuk platform — but only if you have the right documents, a trusted agent, and a clear timeline. In this guide, our Jeddah-based team at <em>Shahid Prime Travel and Tours</em> walks you through every step, from passport preparation to arrival in Makkah.</p>
      <h2>What is an Umrah visa?</h2>
      <p>The Umrah visa is a short-term religious visa issued by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia allowing Muslims to perform Umrah and visit the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah. Since 2023, most Umrah visas are single-entry electronic visas issued via <strong>Nusuk</strong>.</p>
      <h2>Umrah visa requirements from Pakistan (2026)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Passport valid for at least <strong>6 months</strong> from date of travel</li>
        <li>Recent passport-size photograph with white background</li>
        <li>Confirmed return ticket and hotel booking in Makkah/Madinah</li>
        <li>Meningitis (ACWY) vaccination certificate</li>
        <li>Mahram documents for women under 45 (where applicable)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How long does the Umrah visa take?</h2>
      <p>With Shahid Prime, most Umrah visas are approved within <strong>24–72 hours</strong> once documents are complete. We provide same-day status updates via WhatsApp.</p>
      <h2>Common reasons Umrah visas get rejected</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Passport validity under 6 months</li>
        <li>Incomplete vaccination records</li>
        <li>Duplicate or mismatched applicant data</li>
        <li>Previous overstay in Saudi Arabia</li>

      <p>Vision 2030 has opened Saudi Arabia to entrepreneurs like never before. Whether you want a sole proprietorship, an establishment (<em>Muassasah</em>), or a full LLC with foreign ownership, this guide explains how a <strong>Commercial Registration (CR)</strong> works.</p>
      <h2>What is a Saudi CR?</h2>
      <p>The Commercial Registration is the official record proving your business legally exists in the Kingdom. It's issued by the Ministry of Commerce and is required to open a bank account, sign contracts, sponsor employees, or invoice clients.</p>
      <h2>Options for foreigners</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MISA license</strong> — 100% foreign ownership in most sectors</li>
        <li><strong>Saudi partner LLC</strong> — traditional route with local partner</li>
        <li><strong>Establishment</strong> — for Saudi/GCC nationals</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Post-CR compliance</h2>
      <p>After CR, you'll need Chamber of Commerce membership, a Baladiya (municipality) license, ZATCA (VAT/tax) registration, GOSI (social insurance) enrollment, and MOFA attestation for foreign documents.</p>
      <p>Shahid Prime provides <a href="/services/cr-provider">end-to-end CR issuance</a> and post-setup compliance in Jeddah and across KSA.</p>

      <p>Both Hajj and Umrah are sacred pilgrimages to Makkah, but they differ in several important ways.</p>
      <h2>Timing</h2>
      <p><strong>Hajj</strong> is performed only during Dhul Hijjah (8–13). <strong>Umrah</strong> can be performed any time of the year.</p>
      <h2>Obligation</h2>
      <p>Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam — obligatory once in a lifetime for those able. Umrah is highly recommended (Sunnah/Mustahabb) but not obligatory.</p>
      <h2>Rituals</h2>
      <p>Umrah consists of Ihram, Tawaf, Sa'i and Halq/Taqsir. Hajj adds Wuquf at Arafah, Muzdalifah, stoning at Jamarat, and animal sacrifice.</p>
      <h2>Cost</h2>
      <p>Hajj packages are considerably more expensive because of the fixed dates and Mina/Arafat accommodation. Umrah is much more flexible and affordable.</p>
